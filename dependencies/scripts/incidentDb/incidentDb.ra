# configure .ra file for doAutoTrack.pl
#
# specify your top-level /hive/data/.../ pathname
# in which all work should take place:

workDir /hive/data/outside/ncbi/incidentDb/testAuto

# A date-stamped named directory will be constructed under
# that workDir in which all scripts should do their work.
# Each script is given that path as an argument.
# The scripts should go to that directory and construct
#	whatever hierarchy they would like.
#
# Any output from the scripts, to stdout or stderr, will go
#	into a log file under workDir/log/.../
#
# Specify your scripts for each procedure here:
#
download /hive/data/outside/ncbi/incidentDb/testAuto/download.sh
process /hive/data/outside/ncbi/incidentDb/testAuto/process.sh
load /hive/data/outside/ncbi/incidentDb/testAuto/load.sh
verify /hive/data/outside/ncbi/incidentDb/testAuto/verify.sh
push /hive/data/outside/ncbi/incidentDb/testAuto/push.sh
cleanup /hive/data/outside/ncbi/incidentDb/testAuto/cleanup.sh
#
# Each script should be able to determine if it can run due to
#	output from previous steps.  Return 0 for success,
#	any non-zero for non-success.  Doing nothing can be success
#	when appropriate.
